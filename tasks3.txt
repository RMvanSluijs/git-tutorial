- Locally go back to the main branch.
- Make sure it is up to date with the merging that happened on the server (probably you need to pull the newest changes again).
- Make two new branches locally, make following changes:
    - branch a) remove your answers from questions.txt
    - branch b) rewrite all your answers in capital letters
- Commit and push both branches.
- Create a pull request for both branches.
- Merge on github first branch a and then the other.
- Try to understand the conflicts that happen from this workflow and resolve it (you want the answers to be in capital letters).
